#PURCHASE ESTIMATION
The Purchase Estimation project is an interesting data analysis project that can be tackled using various machine learning algorithms. In this project, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately estimate the likelihood of a customer making a purchase. 

Two popular machine learning algorithms that can be used to tackle this problem are Random Forest Classification and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

To implement this project using Random Forest Classification and SVM, the following steps was followed:

1) Data collection and preprocessing: Collect the data required for the project, including demographic and transactional attributes such as age, gender, income, transaction history, and purchase history. Clean and preprocess the data to remove any missing values, outliers, or errors.

2) Feature engineering: Create new features by combining the existing features to extract more information from the data. 

3) Feature selection: Select the most relevant features that are most important in predicting the likelihood of a customer making a purchase. 

4)Model training: Split the data into training and validation sets and train the Random Forest Classification and SVM models on the training set. 

5) Model evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the models on the validation set using metrics 
such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

In conclusion, the "Purchase Estimation" project is an interesting and challenging data analysis project that can be tackled using various machine learning algorithms. Random Forest Classification and Support Vector Machine are two popular algorithms that can be used to develop a predictive model for this project.
